# rag-bot-engine
Rag Bot Engine is a versatile service that empowers users to create unlimited Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bots tailored to their personal knowledge base or data.


Built using ``LLama-Index`` which simplifies creation RAG applications much easier.

**Note**: An ``Admin Dashboard`` will be launched soon once the backend becomes more stable and consistently delivers quality responses. This will simplify the management, usage, and integration of RAG Bots created with the RAG BOT ENGINE into any UI.
